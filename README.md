## About

This was a project I created for my college extended project to get extra credits on the course. I used a custom PHP framework I created while on the [Object Oriented PHP & MVC online course](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-VV13WDP8/). It is a much simpler version of a platform like gumtree, where users can post products they want to sell. Feel free to make an account and have a look around.
